    let sam = "sam";
    let sam2 = sam;
    console.log(sam, sam2);
    sam = "sebas";
    console.log(sam, sam2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = "jhon";
    console.log(team);
    console.log(players);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const people = [...players];
    console.log(people);
    people[3] = "panchi";
    console.log(people);
    console.log(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const peps = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const jugadores = players.slice();
    console.log(jugadores);
    jugadores[3] = "manuel";
    console.log(jugadores);
    console.log(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    console.clear();
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(captain);
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 50});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
